## Responsive Webpage sample
##### In this exercise, I've created a fully responsive webpage using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and media queries.
##### The page's header is set up with a logo on the left side of the viewport and an adjacent navigation menu. 
##### The nav menu is displayed as a "hamburger" menu at mobile resolution.
##### The section is made of two columns created with Bootstrap, they include text and image, which will re-adjust position according to screen resolution. This is achieved using media queries settings for mobile and tablet.
##### The color of the text is consistent across the page
